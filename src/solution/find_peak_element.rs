    /// # [162. Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)
    ///
    /// A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
    ///
    /// Given a **0-indexed**  integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks** .
    ///
    /// You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž`. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
    ///
    /// You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.
    ///
    /// **Example 1:**
    ///
    /// ```txt
    /// Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
    /// Output: 2
    /// Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.```
    ///
    /// **Example 2:**
    ///
    /// ```txt
    /// Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
    /// Output: 5
    /// Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.```
    ///
    /// **Constraints:**
    ///
    /// - `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
    /// - `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
    /// - `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all valid `i`.
