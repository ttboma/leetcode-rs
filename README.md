# Introduction

Hi,

Traditionally, the first step in learning a new programming language is writing a "Hello, World!" program. Another effective approach, based on my experience, is starting a project that involves solving [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems. This method not only reinforces fundamental programming concepts but also offers practical experience with real-world challenges.

This repository is a Rust library crate that offers a diverse collection of solutions to various LeetCode problems. By engaging with this project, you will gain practical experience in several key areas:

- **Toolchains, Package Managers, Build Tools, and Cross-Platform Development**:
  - **Toolchains**: Familiarize yourself with the toolchain for each programming language, including its compilers, interpreters, and build systems.
  - **Build Tools**: Leverage tools like Make, CMake, Cargo (for Rust), and others to automate the build and testing processes efficiently.
  - **Cross-Platform Development**: Ensure your code is compatible with various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) by addressing platform-specific issues and dependencies.
  - **Package Management**: Utilize package managers such as npm (for JavaScript), Cargo (for Rust), and pip (for Python) to manage dependencies and simplify development tasks.
  - **Package Creation and Distribution**: Learn how to create, publish, and manage packages or libraries for reuse and distribution.

- **Library and Binary Development**: Develop and oversee a Rust library crate, along with a binary for console applications stored in the `bin` directory. We use the [clap](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/) library for command-line argument parsing and the [nom](https://docs.rs/nom/latest/nom/) library for input parsing.

- **Utilize Git and Git Hooks**: Gain proficiency in Git for version control and explore [Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/zh-tw/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) to automate tasks within your Rust project. Use the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) framework to handle code quality hooks across various languages.

- **IDE Utilization with VSCode**: Leverage Visual Studio Code (VSCode) to streamline the development and debugging process for your Rust projects, including setting up and using Rust-specific extensions.

- **Unit Testing**: Utilize Rust's built-in testing features to create and run unit tests, ensuring your code performs as expected and adheres to quality standards.

- **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Deepen your understanding of data structures and algorithms by implementing them in Rust, enhancing both your problem-solving skills and your proficiency in the language.

This project not only helps you tackle LeetCode problems but also provides valuable hands-on experience with essential Rust development tools and practices.

# Install and Setup

All you need is to install `rustup` from here: [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Please Read the website to get all prerequisite information you need to know about `rustc`, `cargo`, and `rustup`.

```sh
% rustup --version
rustup 1.27.1 (54dd3d00f 2024-04-24)
info: This is the version for the rustup toolchain manager, not the rustc compiler.
info: The currently active `rustc` version is `rustc 1.78.0 (9b00956e5 2024-04-29)`
% rustc --version
rustc 1.78.0 (9b00956e5 2024-04-29)
% cargo --version
cargo 1.78.0 (54d8815d0 2024-03-26)
```

# Example Usage

After cloning this library crate using `git clone`, run `cargo test` to execute all unit tests and integration tests.

Here is an example of how to use this library crate in your code:

```rust
use leetcode_rs::Solution;

let ans = Solution::fib(5);
assert_eq!(ans, 5);
```

You can also use the `solution` binary through the command line interface:

```bash
% cargo run --bin solution -- --help
% cargo run --bin solution -- help fib
% echo 10 | cargo run --bin solution -- fib
55
```

# API Documentation

For additional LeetCode solution commands beyond `Solution::fib`, you can view the documentation by running `cargo doc --open`.

Alternatively, you can obtain help through the command line interface with the following commands:

```bash
% cargo run --bin solution -- --help
% cargo run --bin solution -- help <COMMAND>
% cargo run --bin solution -- <COMMAND>
```

# Developer's Note

This section contains essential guidelines to help you contribute effectively and maintain high-quality code. Please adhere to the following conventions and recommendations to ensure consistency and efficiency across our development process.

## How to debug with CodeLLDB

To debug using CodeLLDB, press `ctrl+shift+D` and choose names besides the green triangle button from `Debug unit tests in library 'leetcode_rs'`, `Debug executable 'solution'` and `Debug unit tests in executable 'solution'`, if you got `.vscode/launch.json` as the following.
Note that if you need to pass arguments to binary run by cargo, just change the field `args`

```json

## How to debug with lldb

For some reason, the CodeLens shortcut `Debug` is not working for binary.
If you need to use lldb on command line:

```bash
$ lldb ./target/debug/solution -- fib
(lldb) target create "./target/debug/solution"
Current executable set to '/Users/shiehyuehchang/Projects/leetcode/leetcode_rs/target/debug/solution' (arm64).

(lldb) breakpoint set -n main
Breakpoint 1: 2 locations.
